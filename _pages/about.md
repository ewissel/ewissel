I am currently a Postdoctoral research in the Institute of Biomedical Sciences at Academia Sinica in Taiwan. Currently, I am workin in human and microbial genomics, metabolomics, and advanced statistical methods. I am interested in how we make meaning from big piles of data.

I received my PhD from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States where I was a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow (GRFP). With advisors Drs. Vicki Hertzberg and Timothy Read, I studied how urogenital infections during pregnancy may change the gut and vaginal microbiome over time during pregnancy, and may impact the AMR genes in these locations. Good news for patients: I found no major significant results, which means that antibiotics are (still) a life-saving therapy for pathogenic infections during pregnancy will minimal risk from a microbiome perspective. 

I received my B.S. in Psychology from the University of Texas at Austin, where I worked in several research labs, spanning from romantic relationship research to neuroscience. Details on these experiences can be found in my CV or by asking me directly. I also have experience working in biotech and writing community-geared literature on scientific findings (all in the CV).

I am currently exploring topics in the realm of "datafication", or trying to turn everything we experience into some data point, and the broader ethical implications of this from the perspective of a researcher who works with data, and a human who is becoming a multitude of data points. If you're working in these domains or interested in chatting more, reach out. I'd love to work on a collaborative piece together, or just generally chat more.
